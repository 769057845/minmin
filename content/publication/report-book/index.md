Main content:
Wetland plays a pivotal role in sustaining ecosystem service and adapting to climate change. This paper used remote sensing images of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 to investigate the change of wetland of Dongting Lake Basin (DLB) and its possible causes. The land use conversion matrix and contribution rate were calculated in 1990-2000, 2000-2010 and 2010-2020, and results showed that the total wetland area displayed an increasing trend, especially the reservoir ponds and channels across DLB from 1990 to 2020. The forest and agricultural land conversion into wetland accounted for the main proportion, with the most contribution rate (234.13%) of forest land and the smallest rate (-117.46%) of agricultural land between 1990 and 2000. On the contrary, agricultural land had the highest contribution rate (47.96%) for wetlands than other land cover types from 2000 to 2010, followed by forest land (39.03%). The contribution rates of forest and agricultural land to wetlands were 60.17% and 39.02% from 2010 to 2020, respectively. Wetlands showed a more significant net gain (total 259 km2) in the Central and South Hunan Province. More specifically, the wetlands area in the North Hunan Province decreased by 45 km2 from 1990 to 2000. It increased in the next two decades (155 km2 and 22 km2, respectively). The South Hunan province kept increasing from 1990 to 2010 (total 149 km2), while decreasing from 2010 to 2020 (total -297 km2). Forest was the principal driving force to promote the continuous increase of wetland area. Besides, agricultural land was mainly related to wetland change in this region, characterized by reclaiming land from the lake early and returning farmland to wetland later. Build-up land occupied a small quantity of wetland over the study period.
