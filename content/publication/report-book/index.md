## Highlights :
- A fairness-based framework was proposed for the optimal allocation of WEC.
- The optimal allocation of WEC was obtained by minimizing the modified EGC.
- WEC exhibited an upward trend with the increase of the regulation level.
- The optimal allocation of WEC was realized at the strong regulation level.

## Main content :
The allocation of pollutant discharge is challenging work due to conflicts between environmental fairness and efficiency. Water environmental capacity (WEC) is a pivotal metric for the effective control of total pollutant discharge and water environment management. Therefore, a fairness-based decision-making framework for the optimal allocation of the WEC was proposed. To achieve this aim, the environmental Gini coefficient (EGC) was modified through the probability distribution function based on a multi-criteria system. The Luan River Basin of Chengde city in China was selected as a case study to illustrate the application of this novel framework. Specifically, five water environmental function zones and eight calculation units were divided considering the basin characteristics and administrative divisions. Hydrodynamic and advection-dispersion modules in the MIKE 11 model were employed to simulate the migration and transformation processes of water pollutant discharges, and the river one–dimensional model was integrated to assess the WEC. Then, 14 significant influencing factors of WEC were identified by orthogonal experiments, and three water environmental regulation scenarios were designed. Subsequently, the modified EGC was analyzed by establishing the relationships between the WEC and evaluation indices (i.e., population, gross domestic product and land area). The results allowed for the decision-making of an optimal allocation scheme for WEC with the objective function by minimizing the modified EGC. The status quo served as a reference for comparison. As the regulation level improved, the WEC exhibited an upward trend. The largest WEC appeared at the strong regulation level, with values that were 525.97 and 261.27 kg/d larger than those observed at weak and moderate levels, respectively. Additionally, the minimum EGC value occurred at the strong regulation level (<0.7), thereby obtaining the optimal allocation scheme for the WEC. This study presents new insights into the well-informed specific strategies for the optimal allocation of WEC. The proposed framework can be applied to other regulated rivers for pollutant discharge control and water environment management.
