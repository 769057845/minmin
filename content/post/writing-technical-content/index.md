## Model Operation
1. **Delft 3D:** 

To analyze the influence mechanism of cascade dams on aquatic ecosystems, I developed a novel method using biological indices to evaluate river longitudinal connectivity. Recognizing the severe threats posed by numerous large dams to aquatic ecosystems in Southwest China, I selected the largest tributary in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River as a case study.

Using the Delft3D model, I simulated the flow regime characteristics of the river. The results revealed significant differences in longitudinal connectivity among the studied reservoirs. These variations were primarily attributed to factors such as the reservoirsâ€™ locations, spatial distributions, distances, operational strategies, regulatory frameworks, and the cumulative impacts of cascade dams.

My efforts are shown in a first-author publication in Ecological Indicators, which reflects my contributions to advancing the understanding of river ecosystem connectivity.

2. **MIKI model:** 

I developed an integrated framework for water assimilative capacity allocation based on environmental fairness-efficiency trade-offs, utilizing a modified optimization model within a river basin. Using the MIKE II model, I conducted simulations of pollutant generation, diffusion, and transfer dynamics through the hydrodynamic and advection-dispersion modules, considering varying hydrodynamic conditions. The process-based outputs from MIKE II were then incorporated into a water assimilative capacity model.

I further modified the Environmental Gini Coefficient to assess fair-based allocation, determining the optimal distribution of water assimilative capacity by minimizing the objective function with fairness-efficiency trade-offs.

This study has been submitted to Environmental Modelling & Software as a first-author publication. This experience has enhanced my skills in simulating pollutant migration and transformation processes and solving optimization and allocation problems.


3. **Bibliometric Model:** 

I conducted a bibliometric analysis synthesizing three decades of research on global water resources under climate change and land use change, using CiteSpace and R tools. I provided a visual overview of research foci, hotspots, trends, and challenges, based on high-frequency keywords, burst detection, and co-network analysis. The results indicated that the frontier research areas primarily involve the coupled atmosphere-hydrology-terrestrial system, approached through interdisciplinary and multi-scale methods. This research has been submitted to Earth's Future.

4. **SWAT model:** 

In the professional course Water Quality Model and Simulation, she learned to use the SWAT model and applied it to analyze non-point source pollution in watersheds. Through persistent effort, I achieved the highest score in the course (Grade: 96/100).

5. **Environmental forensic models:** 

Source-specific risk identification of heavy metals in the environment is crucial for developing targeted risk mitigation strategies. Therefore, she proposed an integrated, multidisciplinary technological framework for characterizing source-oriented ecological and resistome risks of heavy metals using two environmental forensic models.
