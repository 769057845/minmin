## Overview

1. **Soil plot design, Grass planting and management, Rainfall simulation**

This experimental program was designed for Zhimin Yang’s undergraduate thesis four years ago. Zhimin Yang focused on exploring two grass species on the surface–subsurface flow generation, sediment transportation, and hydraulic and hydrodynamic characteristics in the red soil hilly region. Experimental plots (2 m×0.5 m×0.5 m) using red soil with two rainfall intensities (60 and 120 mm h−1) and grass coverage (30% and 70%) were conducted in laboratory rainfall simulation experiments. Specifically, the soil was filled into the plot and compacted in every 5 cm layer. An upper outlet flush with topsoil was installed to collect the surface flow and sediment during the rainfall simulation, and a lower outlet flush with the bottom of the soil plot was set up to collect the subsurface flow. Two kinds of common native grasses (E. _ophiuroides_ and L. _perenne_) were employed in this study, which can function for soil and water conservation after 3–5 months of growth. The two grass species were strip-sowed on the soil plots and managed by regular watering and fertilization until the desired coverage was achieved. Then, the rainfall was simulated within 90–minute duration using a rainfall simulator. The height of the rainfall simulator was 22.4 m, so the final raindrop speed was similar to that of the natural rainfall before it reached the soil surface. 

During each simulated rainfall event, the initial generation time of surface and subsurface flow were recorded, three bottles (200 mL for each) of water mixed with sediment samples were collected at 3-minute intervals, and then the mixed samples were oven dried at 105 °C for 24 h and weighed to determine the sediment concentration and soil loss rate. The surface flow velocity was measured by a KMnO4 solution coloration at 15–minute intervals after rainfall simulation, and each measure interval was repeated four times. Simultaneously, three bottles of 100 mL mixed water and sediment samples were collected to test the eroded sediment particle size. The sediment samples were analyzed by the Malvern Mastersizer 2000 laser diffraction device (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK), and the particle diameter of the total cumulative sediment particles of 50% (D50) were calculated. When the rainfall simulation was complete, a lagged subsurface flow was collected to calculate its total generation amount.

Regarding this research work, a paper entitled “Roles of the stolon and erect grass species in surface–subsurface flow generation and red soil loss” has been published in the _Journal of Hydrology_.

2. **Lab analysis&chemical analysis**

Zhimin Yang is completing a master’s dissertation on sources and transport processes of organic carbon in a river-reservoir system. Zhimin Yang together with [**Xinghui Xia’s research team**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xinghui-Xia-2) members, went to the cascade reservoirs in the Yellow River Basin to collect the samples of water, sediment and greenhouse gases in May, 2023. The chemical analyses of samples were conducted at the Analysis and Testing Centre of Beijing Normal University which is certificated by the China State Bureau of Technical Supervision. Zhimin Yang used laboratory apparatus such as a total organic carbon analyzer (ATC-241), portable visible spectrophotometer (ATC-211), full-automatic flow injection analyzer (ATC-261), and full-automatic intermittent chemical analyzer (TC-228), to measure some water quality indicators (i.e., TN、TP、TC、COD、DOC、DTN、NH4+-N、NO3--N、NO2--N、PO43--P). The composition and structure of organic materials were conducted using spectroscopic instruments (EEM, UV), and three greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) at the water-atmosphere interface were calculated using a greenhouse gas analyzer.

Regarding this research work, a paper entitled “_Review of reservoir carbon cycle research: influence mechanism and research methods_” has been submitted to _npj Clean Water_ (Under review).
