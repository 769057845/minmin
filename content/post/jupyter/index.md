## Overview

1. **Soil plot design, Grass planting and management, Rainfall simulation**

For her bachelor's thesis, she conducted a simulated rainfall experiment to investigate how grass structures and components influence surface and subsurface runoff, sediment transport, and hydrodynamic characteristics, particularly under extreme rainfall conditions. Two widely used endemic grass species—stoloniferous Eremochloa ophiuroides and erect Lolium perenne—were selected for their applicability in watershed management.

She established experimental plots (2 m × 0.5 m × 0.5 m) with red soil, testing under two rainfall intensities (60 mm h⁻¹ and 120 mm h⁻¹) and varying grass coverage levels (0%, 30%, and 70%). The results indicated that stoloniferous grass outperformed erect grass in soil and water conservation, even under low coverage and high rainfall intensity. The superior performance of Eremochloa ophiuroides was attributed to its above-ground features (e.g., canopy density, leaf area, quality, hardness, stem structure) and robust underground root systems.

2. **Lab analysis&chemical analysis**

Her findings were published as a first-author paper in the Journal of Hydrology, showcasing her contributions to understanding hydrological processes. This experience has greatly enriched her perspective on the mechanisms driving hydrological dynamics.
