## Overview

1. **Instrument measurement**

The water quality indicators such as TN, TP, TC, COD, DOC, DTN, NH4+- N, NO3-- N, NO2-- N, PO43-- P were measured in the State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation and the Analysis and Test Center of the Institute of Agricultural Environment and Sustainable Development of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences with instruments such as ATC-241 total organic carbon analyzer, ATC-211 portable visible spectrophotometer, ATC-261 full-automatic flow injection analyzer and TC-228 full-automatic intermittent chemical analyzer, The composition and structure of organic compounds (EEM, UV) were measured using spectroscopic instruments, and three greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) at the water gas interface were calculated using a greenhouse gas analyzer.

## Overview

2. **Grass planting on soil plots in the rainfall simulation**

Under the condition of indoor simulated rainfall, the red soil in the southern hilly area was used as the soil for the experimental soil trough, and the two common local herbs in the south, Pseudosimon (stolon) and Ryegrass (erect stem), were taken as the research objects. Three levels of no vegetation coverage (bare control), 30% vegetation coverage and 70% vegetation coverage were set. Under the conditions of rain intensity of 60 mm/h (heavy rain) and 120 mm/h (rainstorm), the duration was 90 minutes, Measure surface runoff, sediment concentration, soil flow rate, runoff velocity, and particle size data every 3 minutes, and calculate erosion rate, soil flow coefficient, average particle size D50, Reynolds number (Re), Froude number (Fr), Darcy Weisbach resistance coefficient (f), Manning roughness coefficient (n), and runoff shear force under different herbaceous measures（ τ）、 Runoff power (w), and other indicators, and analyze their correlation.
