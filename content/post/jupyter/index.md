## Overview

1. **Instrument measurement**

The water quality indicators such as TN, TP, TC, COD, DOC, DTN, NH4+- N, NO3-- N, NO2-- N, PO43-- P were measured in the State Key Laboratory of Water Environment Simulation and the Analysis and Test Center of the Institute of Agricultural Environment and Sustainable Development of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences with instruments such as ATC-241 total organic carbon analyzer, ATC-211 portable visible spectrophotometer, ATC-261 full-automatic flow injection analyzer and TC-228 full-automatic intermittent chemical analyzer, The composition and structure of organic compounds (EEM, UV) were measured using spectroscopic instruments, and three greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) at the water gas interface were calculated using a greenhouse gas analyzer.

## Overview

2. **Grass planting on soil plots in the rainfall simulation**

Under the condition of indoor simulated rainfall, the red soil in the southern hilly area was used as the soil for the experimental soil trough, and the two common local herbs in the south, Pseudosimon (stolon) and Ryegrass (erect stem), were taken as the research objects. Three levels of no vegetation coverage (bare control), 30% vegetation coverage and 70% vegetation coverage were set. Under the conditions of rain intensity of 60 mm/h (heavy rain) and 120 mm/h (rainstorm), the duration was 90 minutes, Measure surface runoff, sediment concentration, soil flow rate, runoff velocity, and particle size data every 3 minutes, and calculate erosion rate, soil flow coefficient, average particle size D50, Reynolds number (Re), Froude number (Fr), Darcy Weisbach resistance coefficient (f), Manning roughness coefficient (n), and runoff shear force under different herbaceous measuresÔºà œÑÔºâ„ÄÅ Runoff power (w), and other indicators, and analyze their correlation.

## Model Operation
- **SWAT model:** In Professor Ouyang Wei's water quality modeling and simulation class, Yangzhimin learned and applied the SWAT model to analyze non point source pollution in the Luan River Basin.

- **MIKI model:** With the support of the research group's project, the MIKI model was used to construct a hydrodynamic and water quality model for the Luanhe River Basin in Chengde City, simulating the concentration changes of four pollutants, COD, NH3-N, TN, and TP, in the study area. Calibrate important parameters using measured data and validate them using Nash coefficient, average absolute percentage error, and relative error. Based on the hydrodynamic water quality model of the Luanhe River Basin in Chengde City, the water environment functional zones and calculation units are divided, and the water environment capacity is calculated using the one-dimensional water quality model formula of the river.
