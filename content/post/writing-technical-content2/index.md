## Spatial analyses
1. **ArcGIS:** 

As one of her final assignments in the graduate course Environmental Forensics, Zhimin focused on understanding how water pollutants, sediments, and nutrients are transported from land surfaces to rivers and exploring potential risk mitigation strategies. Therefore, she proposed an integrated, multidisciplinary technological framework and applied it to characterize the source-oriented ecological risks associated with the geochemical enrichment of heavy metals, integrating spatial analyses and forensic models in urban river sediments.

First, she used ArcGIS and several geochemical tools to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of twelve heavy metal elements from upstream to downstream in the river. Then, she applied the PMF and Unimix models to quantitatively identify the sources of these elements and compared the results of both models. Finally, the apportionment results from the two models were combined and incorporated into a modified index to evaluate the source-specific ecological risks, considering hydrological processes and their interactions with human activities.

These efforts are reflected in a first-author publication in Chemosphere. This experience enhanced her skills in tracing the sources of riverine pollutants from land surfaces to rivers.


2. **Remote Sensing:** 

Zhimin conducted research on her hometown during her undergraduate studies, using remote sensing to explore land use variations and wetland conversions in the Dongting Lake Basin from 1990 to 2020. She found that the total wetland area increased, particularly in the reservoir ponds and channels. Forestation was the principal driving force behind the continuous wetland expansion. Moreover, agricultural land was closely linked to wetland fluctuations in her hometown, Hunan Province, characterized by land reclamation from lakes during 1990–2000 and the return of agricultural land to wetlands during 2010–2020. These efforts are reflected in a first-author publication in Sustainability.
