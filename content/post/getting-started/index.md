## Overview

1. **Sample collection and processing in the Yellow River Basin and Yangtze River Basin**

In May 2023, Zhimin Yang went to the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River to explore the influence mechanism of cascade reservoirs on organic materials such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC). She collected water, sediment, and greenhouse gas samples in Longyangxia, Laxiwa, Lijiaxia, and Liujiaxia reservoirs. To understand the damming effect and accumulative effect of cascade reservoirs, the reservoir area, head, and tail were all considered. These works are prepared for the master’s graduation thesis.

Two years ago, Zhimin Yang went to the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River and focused on five reservoirs (Jinping I, Jinping II, Guandi, Ertan, and Tongzilin hydropower stations). The cascade reservoirs’ location characteristics, operations, and regulations were investigated. Furthermore, the changes in flow regimes, sediment distribution, organic matter transport, aquatic communities and ecosystems caused by artificial barriers were explored. Regarding this research work, a paper entitled “A novel index-based method associated with the aquatic ecosystem for evaluating river longitudinal connectivity: A case study for cascade dams in the Yalong River, China” has been published in _Ecological_ _Indicators_.

## Overview

2. **Investigation and survey in the Yellow River Basin**

Due to the construction of many water conservancy and hydropower projects, aquatic community diversity decreased, and biological habitat disappeared in the Yellow River basin. Constructing the water ecological compensation mechanism in the Yellow River basin is urgent. There are many international eco-compensation practices, such as _Wetlands Mitigation Bank Eco-Compensation_ in the U.S., _Catskill Watershed Payment for Ecosystem Service Project_ in the U.S., _Tennessee Valley Eco-Compensation_, etc.

In July 2022, Zhimin Yang went to the Yellow River Delta to explore the eco-compensation mechanism of the Yellow River, financially supported by the Asian Development Bank (TA-6605 PRC:54026-005). The members of the team included the dean of Beijing Normal University Pro. Hongguang Cheng (chg@bnu.edu.cn), the deputy director of Water Safety Research Institute Pro. Changsen Zhao (zhaochangsen@bnu.edu.cn), Pro. Chunhui Li (chunhuili@bnu.edu.cn) and so on.
